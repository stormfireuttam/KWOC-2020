### Project Name : DS - ALGO - SOLUTIONS
### Mentor :  Aditya Bisoi 
### Project Description 
A collection of solutions for HackerRank data structures and algorithm problems in Python, JAVA, and CPP. This community-owned project aims to bring together the solutions for the DS & Algo problems a cross various platforms, along with the resources for learning them. Problems from Leetcode will be included soon in the project.

### About KWoC
Kharagpur Winter of Code is a 5-week long online programme for the students, who are new to open source software development. The programme not only helps students to get involved in open source, but also preps them for many open source summer programmes, Google Summer of Code being one of them.

### About Me
- üî≠ I‚Äôm currently pursuing my Undergraduation in B.Tech(Computer Science).
- I'm a competitive programmerüë®‚Äçüíª, a data science enthusiastüìà and a web developerüåê.
- üå± I‚Äôm currently learning Data Structures and Algorithms to sharpen my coding skills.
- üëØ I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on open source projects related to data science, web development and problem solving.

### My KWoC Experience
KWoC has granted me with tremendous learning opportunities; from improving coding skills to learning git commands. I was introduced to Git through one of my fellowmates and it seemed impressive but I did not had the true knowledge of what all Github was capable of. KWoC showed me the merits of Git Version Control system and under the guidance of my mentor I learnt to contribute to projects in a proper manner. Before working on this project I was not really aware of the use of Readme.md, Pull Requests, Commits, Branches and Issue but now after being part of KWoC I can contribute to open source projects without any issues. I also had the privilage of meeting some of the highly motivated and enthusiastic people through my project. I‚Äôm blessed to have such a group to learn from for my winter break and I‚Äôm thankful to KOSS for the same.

- I was one of the top ten contributors to the [repository](https://github.com/adityabisoi/ds-algo-solutions) with about 116 Pull Requests. In these Pull Requests I provided solutions in Java to the various Hackerrank problems.
- I still remember my [First Pull Request](https://github.com/adityabisoi/ds-algo-solutions/pull/26) in which I provided the code for adding a node at head of a Linked List, adding a node at tail of a Linked List, adding a node at a specific position and deleting a node from a specific position.
- After first few pull requests things started becoming a bit difficult because none of my pull requests were committed so I contacted my mentor and he told me about the contribution guidelines. In the start it was kinda tough to maintain the markdown as well as provide the code for the solutions but with time everything started becoming easier and flawless.
- I was also made the collaborator for the project wherein I was assigned to review the code of other developers and merge the pull requests which follow the contribution guidelines.

At last I would like to say it was a great experience being a part of the KWoC as it not only helped me in learning about Github but also helped me in learning about Open Source contribution.
