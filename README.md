### About KWoC
Kharagpur Winter of Code is a 5-week long online programme for the students, who are new to open source software development. The programme not only helps students to get involved in open source, but also preps them for many open source summer programmes, Google Summer of Code being one of them.

### About Me
- 🔭 I’m currently pursuing my Undergraduation in B.Tech(Computer Science).
- I'm a competitive programmer👨‍💻, a data science enthusiast📈 and a web developer🌐.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Data Structures and Algorithms to sharpen my coding skills.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects related to data science, web development and problem solving.

### My KWoC Experience
KWoC has granted me with tremendous learning opportunities; from improving coding skills to git commands. I was introduced to Git through one of my fellowmates
and it seemed impressive but I did not had the true knowledge of what all Github was capable of. KWoC showed me the merits of Git Version Control system and under the guidance of my mentor I learnt to contribute to projects in a proper manner. Before working on this project I was not really aware of the use of Readme.md, Pull Requests, Commits, Branches and Issue but now after being part of KWoC I can contribute to open source projects without any issues. I also had the privilage of meeting some of the highly motivated and enthusiastic people through my project. I’m blessed to have such a group to learn from for my winter break and I’m thankful to KOSS for the same.
